# Comfy

Making the command-line experience comfy, we stand on the shoulders of giants.

This script is designed to automate the UI/UX setup of a bare server environment with *sensible* defaults. It installs (my) commonly used packages, sets up essential aliases, and configures tools like `neovim` and `btop`. You can easily customize the script by selecting which packages to exclude from installation.

## Features

`nvim`, `btop` & `yazi` basically making you comfy.
